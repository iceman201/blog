# TestFlight Release

***just a short report of what I did recently***

Last week, Yunchen(My project partner) and me we released the first version on TestFlight for external testing. Send to some of the friends, get quite few feedbacks, good and bad. I gotta say Thank you to all the friends who testing my APP and give to me so much usefull information.

For the APP, if the application hasnt dead, then there is no limit on designing, and always has a space to improve. This is what I believe. Now I'm gona load the issues and keep following my design cycle.

```
Design  ➡️ Implement
⬆️          ⬇️
Analyze ⬅️ Evaluate   

```

Furthermore, GymWorkoutManager I just made this name from beginning, now the application nearly released I gotta give it a new name, shorter and a way cool name.
