# Poke CP

Pokemon Go has been release for a while, glad that I am living in New Zealand the one of the first release countries. I heard from ZM FM talking about Pokemon Go announcer said ‚ÄúPeople are getting crazy of playing Pokemon Go!!!‚Äù HAHA. Anyway, when it release there are some web-tools come out online as well, such as [PokeVision](http://pokevision.com/), [PogoToolKit](http://pogotoolkit.com/) so on. 

However, people play the game on phone when they use the tool they have to open browser and type the address, which is bit inconvenience. so I want build up an APP tool for pokemon player, people wont be bother of typing address or waiting for page open, I will move some of the feature to the App so it will run local and fast. Since the map searching function of pokemon API closed, I cant do anything like PokeVision function but I can do a Pokemon evolution calculator. 

The project start mid-August this year(2016), since the propose of this App is pretty simple and clear, so I spend more time on the UI Design and try to find a design language which suit into this project the most. Currently, the project has been done already, 2 times testFlight released. just need some more data check/correction.

After Swift3 released my old project Gymme Dairy(GymWorkoutManager) has some functional issues that I need to re-write and modify 3rd party frameworks, the release date probably will delay. üò£ Anyway this is my project report of this month üòä
