# Getting into Web?

last time I touch website development thats like ages ago possiblely html1.0? windows me just release? if I didnt remember wrong. My school teacher were teaching us use MS Frontpage and Dreamweaver. I found out HTML is so hard to read because those <> </> such symbols, so I give it up.

After University study, I did algorithm, computer graphic, embedded system, network and communication, automaton design, but website development. After graduate from university, I saw there were huge demande of web developer. Not only senior or intermedia web developer, but also junior or graduate web developer. It remind me a question, the furture.

My first time to purchase iPhone4, after hold on my hand it's so pretty and poweful function. It's like you can do 'heaps' things on your hand. After years and years mobile phone function getting pretty much compeleted, now you can do pretty much 'every' thing on your hand. Creating an application become my next plan, I purchase a macbook pro and start coding ios App, good thing is Apple release swift programming language. Since the first programming language I learn is python and , so pick up swift isnt too hard for me. Actually, swift is more like little bit of everything. I guess thats why Apple try to make swift syntax be more swift from each version update. Coding app is fun I love it for sure, but since HTML5 come out website isnt the same as the old stage. 
I dont know the future of mobile development and website development, but, obviously, the two things are getting closer and closer thats for sure. 

My currently gold is keep improving my swift skill and learning website development part-time.
I found this artical on the internet, I believe it's true.
