Left-side is the old design, pretty rough. I dont want release my app with a such ugly interface.
The main idea of this right side design is that I want to demonstrate is a dynamic interaction with few buttons to link each view, so the applications looks alive/actived instead of a boring interaction design.
the animation framework is from *ramotion*, the button icon is myself designs. Meanwhile, I re-designed the app icon. Idea is from Japanese flower, draw by *Pixelmator*

```
* The color source code

let GWMColorGray = UIColor(red: 175.0/255.0, green: 182.0/255.0, blue: 181.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
let GWMColorLightGray = UIColor(red: 233.0/255.0, green: 236.0/255.0, blue: 237.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)
let GWMColorGold = UIColor(red: 253.0/255.0, green: 210.0/255.0, blue: 72.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0)

let GWMColorBackground = UIColor(red: (65.0 / 255.0), green: (65.0 / 255.0), blue: (65.0 / 255.0), alpha: 1.0)
let GWMColorYellow = UIColor(red: (221.0 / 255.0), green: (255.0 / 255.0), blue: (112.0 / 255.0), alpha: 1.0)
```
