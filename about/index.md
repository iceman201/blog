### KIA ORA,

My name is Liguo Jiao a.k.a iceman201. 25 years old graduated from University of Canterbury, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Living in Auckland, New Zealand. Iâ€™m an iOS developer with 2 years experience in Swift. I have been contributed to **Sidewinder** and **SCADAFarm** iOS Application, and get involved with build up **RefitPlaner** iOS Application. Meanwhile, I'm also running an on-going self-project with couple of friends named **GymWorkoutManager** iOS Application.

Mobile Application development is so much fun for me I love to design application, I perfer a clean and cute visual design, and also with useful & intenional interaction. I eager learn new things to extend the limit of my knowledge. Therefore, I am running the Swift New Zealand github group to invite more Swift developers (worldwide) to do project together as a way to learn from each other.
